Config-Editor
=============

This is a Config Editor for OpenTTD
It is currently a work in progress.
It reads the openttd.cfg file and puts the lines in an ArrayList,
then you can modify them using the GUI, and save the file, over-writing the old one.
The program only supports the config options
in the dificulty and vehicle lists:

This program is used at your own risk. I am just learning java, so I am not really
able to provide support.
